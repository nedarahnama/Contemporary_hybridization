Genome Assembly
Hifiasm analyses, incorporating a k-mer size of 21 and high-quality reads (A. nemorensis: 2.18 million reads; A. sagittata: 1.98 million reads), yielded genome sizes of 245 Mb for A. nemorensis and 249 Mb for A. sagittata (Suppl. File 2, Table 1). The primary assembly for A. nemorensis contained 3,084 contigs, while A. sagittata contained 2,361 contigs. The N50 length was 17.4 Mb for A. nemorensis and 27.6 Mb for A. sagittata.
After scaffolding with the A. alpina genome using RagTag, the N50 length increased to 26.6 Mb for A. nemorensis and 28.4 Mb for A. sagittata. Complete BUSCO scores were 99.3% for A. nemorensis and 99.4% for A. sagittata, confirming high genome completeness. The final number of scaffolds for both species was reduced to eight, corresponding to the expected chromosome number. Comparative analyses of the genome assemblies revealed potential inversions at several locations on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (Figure S5). To determine whether these represent biological structural inversions or assembly-related artifacts, these positions were cross-referenced with the genetic map, and inverted accordingly (Figure S6).
